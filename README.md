In the utils.py file, there are three functions; The createExcel function creates an excel file with two sheets and populates the first three columns of the 100 rows of the first sheet with random numbers from 0 to 10. The findRoots function treats the three random numbers coefficients of a quadratic and finds the roots of the quadratic. The loadExcel function writes the roots to the second sheet of the excel file.
